# Scraping

- Do you know that hotel consulting companies use the data they collect from Online Travel Agencies (OTA) like Tripadvisor, Expedia, Booking.com, Airbnb, etc to do market research and develop a strategy for a new hotel?

- By collecting the prices of different room types of the existing hotels, they determined the reasonable price range they wanted their rooms to fall in.

- By collecting the images of the hotelsâ€™ interior & exterior decoration, they determined the overall design of the new hotel.

- By collecting the amenities and facilities, they determined the amenities and features they wanted the new hotel to have.

- By collecting the distances to the tourist attraction, airport, train station, bus station, etc, they determined the best location of the new hotel.

- All this information, just to make sure once the hotel was built, nothing will prevent it from being a huge success.

This repository consists of sample scraping scripts to get the data of products of the one of the major ecommerce sites "Flipkart" and reviews of the "Spirit Airlines" in Trip Advisor.

The data obtained through scraping can be used for many purposes:

- Price monitoring in Ecommerce
- Conduct customer sentiment analysis on reviews of Hotels to improve its business
